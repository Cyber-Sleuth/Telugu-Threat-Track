Malware Analysis Course Labs

Welcome to the Malware Analysis Course Labs repository. This collection of labs is designed to complement the lessons in the Telugu Malware Analysis Course by providing practical, hands-on experience in analyzing malicious software. These labs are aimed at students, working professionals, and freelancers who are looking to develop a solid understanding of static and dynamic malware analysis techniques.

📚 Course Overview

This repository contains the following types of labs:

    Static Analysis – Analyzing malware without executing it, focusing on binary and file analysis.
    Dynamic Analysis – Running malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.
    Network Analysis – Investigating the network traffic generated by malicious software.
    Reverse Engineering – Disassembling and decompiling malware to understand its internals.

Each lab includes clear instructions, practical tasks, and the necessary resources to complete the exercises.
🛠 Prerequisites

Before beginning the labs, ensure you have the following tools installed:

    Static Analysis Tools: PEiD, Dependency Walker, Strings
    Dynamic Analysis Tools: Cuckoo Sandbox, Process Monitor, Process Explorer
    Network Analysis Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump
    Reverse Engineering Tools: Ghidra, IDA Pro, x64dbg

    Note: You should run these tools in a virtualized environment to ensure safety when working with potentially harmful malware samples.

📝 Lab Instructions

Each lab is located in its respective folder, with detailed instructions on how to complete the analysis tasks. To get started:

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/Cyber-Sleuth/Telugu-Threat-Track.git
    cd Telugu-Threat-Track

    Navigate to the folder of the specific lab you want to work on.


💡 Tips for Analysis

    Always use a sandboxed or isolated environment when working with malware to avoid infecting your machine.
    Use a combination of static and dynamic analysis for a comprehensive understanding of the malware’s behavior.
    Pay close attention to network indicators and file signatures as they often provide crucial evidence of malicious activity.

📄 Reporting Results

At the end of each lab, you are expected to generate a report detailing your findings. Reports should include:

    Malware sample details (hashes, file names, etc.)
    Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
    Behavioral analysis (network traffic, file changes, etc.)
    Remediation recommendations
